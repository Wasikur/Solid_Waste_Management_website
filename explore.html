                <h2>Solid Waste Management Plant, Dibrugarh</h2>
                <p>Assam's first solid waste management project was inaugurated by Union Minister Rameswar Teli in the
                    Thakurthan area at Lekai. This area is located on the outskirts of Dibrugarh. For a long time, the
                    residents had been facing a lot of problems due to the unavailability of proper garbage disposal
                    unit."</p>>

                <p>Earlier, garbage and waste materials were dumped in the Maijan area near river Brahmaputra in
                    Dibrugarh, causing pollution to the entire area. Hence, due to this, the Dibrugarh district
                    have come up with the project and it was successfully inaugurated today. The budget for the building
                    of the project is said to be Rs. 75.03 crores on a 28.3-hectare plot of land.
                    The project was built under the Assam Urban Infrastructure Investment Programme (AUIIP). The solid
                    waste management project is capable of converting waste of 100 metric tonnes per day (TPD) into
                    compost. The project began in 2017 under AUIIP at Lekai.</p>>

                <p>The town of Dibrugarh had been dumping waste at the Maijan Ghat along the Brahmaputra river until now
                    in an unscientific matter. The 22 municipalities of Dibrugarh town produce about 80 metric tonnes of
                    solid waste every day.</p><br>

                <h2>Purpose of choosing the process of bio-methanation and pyrolysis for managing the waste generated.
                </h2>
                <p><b>1.</b> This is a very simple and inexpensive technology.<br>
                    <b>2.</b> It can be used for continuous production of biofuels and organic fertilizer.<br>
                    <b>3.</b> The operating conditions are moderate and less severe.<br>
                    <b>4.</b> Less human effort required and requires less maintenance cost.<br>
                    <b>5.</b> It has the potential to reduce the countryâ€™s dependence on fossil fuels.<br>
                    <b>6.</b> Also minimizes the problems associated to the existing waste management techniques
                    followed in Dibrugarh district.
                </p><br>

                <h2>Working of the process:</h2>
                <p><b>Step 1:</b> The waste materials are collected from door to door and transported to the Solid
                    Waste Management Plant.<br>
                    <b>Step 2:</b> The waste materials are segregared in the Plant.<br>
                    <b>Step 3:</b> The pre-treatment and processing of biodegradable waste is done in the
                    biomethanation plant and the pre-treatment and processing of non-biodegradable waste (excluding
                    glass and metal waste) is done in the pyrolysis plant.<br>
                    <b>Step 4:</b> Recycling of the glass, metal and ceramic waste is done.<br>
                    <b>Step 5:</b> New products are made from the recycled materials.<br>
                    <b>Step 3:</b> The products are supplied to the market again.
                </p><br>

                <h2>Benefits of using the method of biomethanation and pyrolysis for management of waste.</h2>
                <p><b>1.</b> Disposal of wastes in landfill areas is one of the major cause of global warming due to
                    production
                    of methane and carbon dioxide which could be reduced significantly by using the method of
                    biomethanation.<br>
                    <b>2.</b> Using biomethanation and pyrolysis the area required for landfilling can be minimized to a
                    great
                    extent which is one of the major drawbacks of the existing waste management system.<br>
                    <b>3.</b> It could serve as green source for income to the society.<br>
                    <b>4.</b> Producing fuels from waste would help in reducing the dependency and concerns related to
                    the use
                    of fossil fuels.<br>
                    <b>5.</b> Setting up of the biomethanation plant and pyrolysis plant would provide jobs to the local
                    people
                    of the area which in turn improves the economic growth of the country.<br>
                    <b>6.</b> Ineffective disposal of plastic wastes had forced it to enter in the blood stream of human
                    beings, hence it is very much necessary to mange the plastic waste effectively and pyrolysis is one
                    such method.
